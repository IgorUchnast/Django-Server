# Django-Server
It is a server written in the Django framework designed to store measurement data from temperature, smoke and humidity sensors located in Shieldbox chambers, and it is connected to a mobile application written in Flutter. It allows for easy scaling of newly added devices to the server. The data is stored using an SQLite database.
